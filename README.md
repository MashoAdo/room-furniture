### About Website

This is a simple sample website landing page for a furniture selling business. The website has no external links. The left and right arrows are used to navigate to show the different mission statement of the business and the background of the menu section.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use of mixins to make the my css cleaner and modular

```css
@mixin flexDirection($direction) {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: $direction;
	align-items: center;
}

@mixin backgroundPosition($height) {
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-position: center;
	background-size: cover;
	height: $height;
}
```

### Continued development

I will be practicing to develop more complex grids.This will help in responsiveness and layout issues..
